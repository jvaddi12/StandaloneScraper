# StandaloneScraper

The levi review scraper multi page file is to be use in the run multi page scraper for the multi page pagination of the reviews. 

You must export the brightdata API key. 

The run_scrpaer.py file only scrapes the first page of reviews, so if you need multiple pages go to run multi page scraper instead.
